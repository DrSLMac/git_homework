Two takeaways from the first two sessions at Turing:
First, becoming a developer is a lot like learning a new language to effectively figure out a puzzle. Learn the language, work the puzzle.
Second, I can do this. I will have patience and grace for the learning curve, but never doubt that I can do this, and be very good at it. I'm having fun and am at peace with the direction I am going.
Two new strategies to try during Mod 0
1 - Thoroughly prepare for each session ahead of time, studying vocabulary and new commands.
2 - Use focus time and calendar to keep track of time and tasks to complete
Shout Out!
Shout out to Leigh Larson, whom I have never met in person, but took the time to message extensively about her experience while at Turing and the ways that it has changed her life. She was an immense encouragement to me when I was considering making the commitment to change careers.
